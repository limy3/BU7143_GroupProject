BU7143 Business Data Mining Group Project

The goal of this project is to provide a classification model for CMS to accurately predict the high-risk diabetic patients to reduce disproportionate usage of funding by CMS. This will be achieved by accurately identifying and classifying patients who are high-risk diabetics and place them into lifestyle change programs to prevent diabetes. In doing so, would reduce the cost of diabetes patient calims and increase funding for other chronic diseases.

This project was done using R.
